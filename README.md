# FunctionalBadges Reader WIP

## Compile Dependencies
* Boost
* OpenSSL

## Build Dependencies
* CMake 3.12
* Git

## How to Build
1. Install Boost with any package manager. If OpenSSL is not already
installed, install it as well.
2. Run `install_dependencies.sh` as root.
3. Run `build_project.sh` as root.

This places the executable as `./build/FuctionalBadges`
